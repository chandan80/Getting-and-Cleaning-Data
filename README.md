Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

## Objective 

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

* You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Basic Info

* code submitted in Part 1 is generated by running run_analysis.R which writes tidy_average.txt

* the R script assumes that all the data is in current directory, "UCI HAR Dataset/".

* The script requires the package "reshape2"

* No columns in tidy_average.txt contains more than one variable 
> colnames(tidy_average)
[1] "subject"  "activity" "variable" "average"

* > dim(tidy_average)
[1] 11880     4

* in renaming variables mean and std are added as suffix
